# backpack.py

This is a library for Backpack.tf's API

## Getting Started 

```
pip install -U tf2backpackpy
```

### Requirments

 1. Python 3.6 (Most likely works with other versions, hasn't been tested)
 2. pip (For installation)
 3. urllib
 4. requests

## Testing it

To make sure it's working, you can check out the example file, and try that

## Stuff not implemeted yet, but will be

 * [backpack.py](https://github.com/Zwork101/backpack.py/blob/master/tf2backpackpy/backpack.py) ~ create_listings_subscription, delete_listing_subscription
 * [listings.py](https://github.com/Zwork101/backpack.py/blob/master/tf2backpackpy/listings.py) ~ create_listing
 * Might be more listed, usually ther're non-GET requests. Please, I'll do what I can, but usually this is backpack.tf's horrible API
 
I relize I have a couple of things left to add, but those will be for more major updates
